# Tiny Blockchain

**Blockchain** - _a digital ledger in which transactions made in Bitcoin or another cryptocurrency are recorded chronologically and publicly._

In other words, the blockchain is a public database where new data is immutably appended to a chain of historical records. It has given rise to new digital currencies that have no central authority.

To run the app, type in the following:

1. `./run.sh` to start the server.

2. `./transact.sh` to initiate a transaction.

3. `./mine.sh` to mine the transaction.
